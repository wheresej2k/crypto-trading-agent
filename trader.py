"""Entry point. Run this to do one trading pass: reconcile any protective orders that filled
since the last run -> fetch hourly market data -> validate it -> generate signals (free,
rule-based SMA crossover) -> apply risk limits -> place paper orders on Alpaca. Meant to run once
an hour via a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow - crypto trades 24/7, so unlike the stock bot
there's no market-hours gate to check (no --force flag needed here).

Usage:
    python trader.py            # live paper-trading run
    python trader.py --dry-run  # do everything except actually submit orders or touch state
