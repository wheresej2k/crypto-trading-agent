"""Sweeps combinations of strategy parameters (SMA windows, stop-loss/take-profit, confidence
threshold) through the backtest to find the most profitable combination that still passes a
safety filter, instead of just the most profitable combination outright (which tends to mean
"took on more risk and got lucky").

IMPORTANT CAVEAT: picking whatever scored best on historical data is "curve-fitting" - there's a
real risk of tuning to noise that happened to exist in that stretch of history rather than to
anything that will keep working. Treat the winner here as a hypothesis to try on paper, not a
proven result. As a partial check against this, every combination is tested across three
different historical windows (~3 months, ~1 year, ~5 years - close to the full history Alpaca has
for crypto, which starts 2021-01-01).

"Safe" means, across every tested window:
  - its worst drawdown never exceeded SAFE_MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT
  - its win rate never fell below MIN_WIN_RATE_PCT
Among only the combinations that pass both, the winner is whichever made the most money on
average (see avg_return) - return is NOT itself a pass/fail gate. Two earlier designs tried that
and both broke, in opposite directions, once tested against real data (2026-09-14):

1. First attempt: "never net-unprofitable" (return >= 0 in every window). Failed because the
   trailing ~1-year window covers a real, severe crypto-wide crash (buy-and-hold on this
   watchlist lost 31-70% that year) - no long-only strategy can guarantee a positive return while
   the underlying assets collapse that hard.
2. Second attempt: "never underperform buy-and-hold" in every window. Failed in the OPPOSITE
   direction - during a strong rally (like the trailing ~3-month window), any strategy with
   stop-losses that isn't 100% invested at all times will naturally lag a naive buy-and-hold.
   That's the literal cost of having downside protection, not a flaw.

The lesson: return is inherently a noisy, direction-dependent number over any single window - a
strategy can look "bad" by that measure just from which way the market happened to move during
the test period. Drawdown and win rate are the numbers that actually answer "could this wreck my
account" and are what the hard safety gate should be built from. Return still matters - it's how
the winner gets picked among the safe candidates - it just isn't a second gate that a rally or a
crash can arbitrarily fail on its own. Confirmed with the user before landing on this design.

Deliberate design choice: this sweep only touches STRATEGY parameters (the SMA windows,
stop-loss/take-profit, confidence threshold) - it never touches max_position_pct,
max_total_exposure_pct, or max_daily_loss_pct. Those three are your risk-tolerance choice, not a
"what wins backtests" question, and an automated process silently raising how much of your
account it's willing to risk - even in paper trading - is exactly the kind of self-modifying-risk
behavior this project's design brief calls out as needing a human decision, not an algorithm. If
you want to change your risk tier, do that deliberately in config/params.json yourself.

Usage:
    python tune.py            # always fetches fresh history from Alpaca
    python tune.py --cache    # reuses a local cache of historical bars if present - much faster
                               # for repeated iteration, but the cache can go stale. Only use this
                               # while actively experimenting; a real tuning decision (or the
                               # monthly auto-retune) should use fresh data.
